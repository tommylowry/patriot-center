Aggregation utilities over starters data.

Exposes helpers to:
- Aggregate totals across weeks/seasons for a manager by player.
- Aggregate totals across weeks/seasons for a player by manager.

Notes:
- Results are simple dicts suitable for JSON responses.
- Totals are rounded to two decimals via Decimal normalization.
